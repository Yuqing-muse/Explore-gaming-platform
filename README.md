# Explore-gaming-platform
In the game platform, the player's dynamic sharing, game purchase records, like posts, and topics to participate in, etc., could reflect the player's game preferences and personality. In this research, we mainly explore Steam.
This project uses python as the main language. Also, several modules are imported, including sklearn, Matplotlib, requests, pyMongo, urllib, numpy, and so on.

It contains five procedures---data acquisition, data storage, data preprocessing, data analysis and data display. It introduces main requests in Steam Web API. Data mining methods are adopted to analyze game data from two aspects: 1) Conduct clustering using K-Means method to group games into three clusters based on popularity, i.e., most popular, popular and normal. Then explore the relationship between each cluster to AURIN’s data. 2) Multiple linear regression to predict locations based on players’ gaming data.
